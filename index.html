          <h2>What is a Horse Cart?</h2>
          <p>
            A horse cart known as a <em>charrette</em> in Senegal is a
            simple, practical vehicle: a wooden platform on wheels, pulled by a horse,
            used for carrying people or goods. In many regions, it’s affordable,
            efficient, and perfectly adapted to local roads and daily life.
          </p>
          <ul class="bullet">
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> everyday transport for school, market, and errands</li>
            <li><strong>Design:</strong> wooden base, two wheels, seating area, reins</li>
            <li><strong>Value:</strong> low-cost, community-friendly, and reliable</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="card note">
          <h3>Why it matters</h3>
          <p>
            Beyond function, the charrette represents community, simplicity, and
            shared rhythms of life, it’s a cultural sign of being together.

        <h2>My Childhood Memories</h2>
        <p>
          I grew up riding the horse cart 'charrette' to school and activities. I remember the fresh
          morning air, the hooves on the ground, and the friendly waves from neighbors.
          It wasn’t fancy, but it felt free open sky, open road, open heart. I waited 
          at the stop, climbed in with neighbors, and we talked while the cart rolled 
          through the streets. It was cheap, friendly, and reliable. Those short rides 
          felt like a little community on wheels greetings, laughter, and the wind on 
          my face. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Even today, far from home, those rides stay with me. They taught me to value
          what is useful and shared, not just what is modern.
          I’m nostalgic about it because it reminds me of home and simpler days.

            You ride together, you greet people along the way. It’s transport that
            connects people as much as places.

          <h2>Part of Senegalese Culture</h2>
          <p>
            In many regions of Senegal, the horse cart 'charrette' supports daily work and social life.
            It’s a shared solution that respects the pace of the community and environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            For me, it represents hospitality and resilience values I carry with me
            wherever I live.
